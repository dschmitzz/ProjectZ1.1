        <h1>Prime Factorization</h1>
        <p>A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no factors other than 1 and itself.</p>
        <p>The set of prime numbers is {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...}</p>
        <p>The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization.</p>
        <p>For example, the prime factorization of 9 is 3*3 or 3^2.</p>
        <h1>Pairwise Relatively Prime</h1>
        <p>Two integers are relatively prime, or coprime, if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1.</p>
        <p>For example, 16 and 21 are coprime.</p>
