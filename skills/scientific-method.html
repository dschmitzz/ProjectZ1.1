                    <p>A scientific <span class="k">fact</span> is a simple observation in the natural world. </p>
                    <p>A <span class="k">hypothesis</span> is a proposed explanation of specific observations that can be tested with experiments. </p>
                    <p>A scientific <span class="k">theory</span> is a general conclusion supported by a large body of evidence that explains <i>why</i> or <i>how</i> some natural phenomenon works. </p>
                    <p>A scientific <span class="k">law</span> is a statement, supported by a large body of evidence, about a relationship between facts. It predicts <i>what</i> will happen, but does not explain why or how. </p>
                    <p>A <span class="k">theorem</span>, or axiom, is a law that is proven to be true for every possible case. It is impossible to definitively prove anything in the natural world, so theorems only exist in the formal sciences (mathematics, logic, etc.). </p>

                    <p>Experiments are designed to test a hypothesis by adjusting one variable (leaving everything else constant) and observing the effects.</p>
                    <p>The <span class="k">independent variable</span> is the factor manipulated by the researchers to elicit some response. </p>
                    <p><span class="k">Dependent variables</span> are the factors affected by the independent variable and measured by the researchers. </p>
                    <p>An <span class="k">experimental group</span> is a group (of animals, objects, etc.) in which the researchers observe the effects the independent variable. </p>
                    <p>A <span class="k">control group</span> is often used next to an experimental group. The researchers do nothing to this group, to see how much change in the dependent variable can be attributed to other factors. </p>
