    <h1>Common Core Math, Grade 5</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Operations and Algebraic Thinking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Write and interpret numerical expressions</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Use parentheses, brackets ,or braces in numerical expressions, and evaluate expressions with these symbols.</li>
                <li>Write simple expressions that record calculations with numbers, and interpret numerical expressions without evaluating them. For example, express the calculation "add 8 and 7, then multiply by 2" as 2 x (8 + 7). Recognize that 3 x (18932 + 921) is three times as large as 18932 + 921, without having to calculate the indicated sum or product.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Analyze patterns and relationships</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate two numerical patterns using two given rules. Identify apparent relationships between corresponding terms. Form ordered pairs consisting of corresponding terms from the two patterns, and graph the ordered pairs on a coordinate plane. For example, givne the rule "Add 3" and the starting number 0, and given the rule "Add 6" and the starting number 0, generate terms in the resulting sequences, and observe that the terms in one sequence are twice the corresponding terms in the other sequence. Explain informally why this is so.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Number and Operations in Base Ten</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand the place value system.</li>
            <li>Perform operations with multi-digit whole numbers and with decimals to hundredths.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Number and Operations&mdash;Fractions</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use equivalent fractions as a strategy to add and subtract fractions</li>
            <li>Apply and extend previous understandings of multiplication and division to multiply and divide fractions.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Measurement and Data</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Convert like measurement units within a given measurement system.</li>
            <li>Represent and interpret data.</li>
            <li>Geometric measurement: understand concepts of volume and relate volume to multiplication and to addition.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Geometry</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Graph points on the coordinate plane to solve real-world and mathematical problems.</li>
            <li>Classify two-dimensional figures into categories based on their properties.</li>
        </ul>
