    <h1>Common Core Math, Grade 3</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Operations and Algebraic Thinking</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Represent and solve problems involving multiplication and division.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Interpred products of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 5 x 7 as the total number of objects in 5 groups of 7 objects each. For example, describe a context in which a total number of objects can be expressed as 5 x 7.</li>
                <li>Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 56 &#247; 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 objects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as 56 &#247; 8.</li>
                <li>Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, e.g., by drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.</li>
                <li>Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations 8 x ? = 48, 5 = ? &#247; 3, 6 x 6 = ?.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Understand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide. Examples: If 6 x 4 = 24 is known, then 4 x 6 = 24 is also known. (Commutative property of multiplication.) 3 x 5 x 2 can be found by 3 x 5 = 15, then 15 x 2 = 30, or by 5 x 2 = 10, then 3 x 10 = 30. (Associative property of multiplication.) Knowing that 8 x 5 = 40 and 8 x 2 = 16, one can find 8 x 7 as 8 x (5 + 2) = (8 x 5) + (8 x 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property).</li>
                <li>Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, find 32 &#247; 8 by finding the number that makes 32 when multiplied by 8.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Multiply and divide within 100.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 x 5 = 40, one knowns 40 &#247; 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all product sof two one-digit numbers.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.</li>

                <li>Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.</li>
                <li>Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition table or multiplication table), and explain them using properties of operations. For example, observe that 4 times a numbe ris always even, and explain why 4 times a number can be decomposed into two equal objects.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Number and Operations in Base Ten</li>

                <li>Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value, properties of operations, and/or the relationship between addition and subtraction.</li>
                <li>Multiply one-digit whole numbers by multiples of 10 in the range 10-90 (e.g., 9 x 80, 5 x 60) using strategies based on place value and properties of operations.</li>

                    <li>Understand two fractions as equivalent (equal) if they are the same size, or the same point on a number line.</li>
                    <li>Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions, e.g., 1/2 = 2/4, 4/6 = 2/3. explain why the fractions are equivalent, e.g., by using a visual fraction model.</li>
                    <li>Express whole numbers as fractions, and recognize fractions that are equivalent to whole numbers. Examples: Express 3 in the form 3 = 3/1; recognize that 6/1 = 6; locate 4/4 and 1 at the same point of a number line diagram.</li>
                    <li>Compare two fractions with the same numerator or the same denominator by reasoning about their size.
